# Enlightened Drugs
## Breakthrough 
> Breakthrough is a drug commonly infused into energy drinks. There are currently three varieties: Clarity, Boost, and Snap. They’re orange, purple, and green flavored, respectively. (Not orange, grape, and apple. They taste orange, purple, and green.) Each type focuses on one Mental Attribute: Clarity for Perception, Boost for Intelligence, and Snap for Wits. They raise the target Attribute by one for four hours.
>  
> **Side Effects:** Breakthrough causes a drinker to doubt himself when not under its effects. After all, the drink makes you smarter, wittier, and more able to notice your surroundings. After its effects end, a character cannot spend Willpower on Mental actions until she’s achieved a Dramatic Success without Willpower.

## Cognition
> Cognition is a classic drug with the Progenitors. It commonly comes in a vaporizer-style inhaler. Use of Cognition decreases the difficulties of all Enlightened Science by one for the day. Cognition works similarly to amphetamine stimulants, which intensify the mind’s ability to focus, but shut out periphery attention. 
> 
> **Side Effects:** Cognition is highly addictive. A difficulty 7 Willpower roll will resist addiction after use. A failed roll means the scientist craves more. Each day without a dose of Cognition raises the difficulty of all Enlightened Science by one, to a maximum of 10. After one week, the symptoms become violent, and the character loses a health level per day. Traditional addiction therapy will help coax them off the drug after two full weeks.

## Tweak
> Tweak is a form of adrenergic drug, one that not only heightens the user’s nerves, but also enhances their Enlightenment briefly. Instead of invigorating the body, it pushes the Enlightened Eidolon to extremes. For the rest of the scene, the character may take an Enlightened Procedure as a reflexive action each turn. Each such Procedure causes one health level of aggravated damage, since one’s Genius isn’t meant for such stress. 
> 
> **Side Effects:** In addition to the injury caused by use, Tweak exhausts its user. After the scene, the character’s dice pools are all halved until she gets a full day’s rest.
